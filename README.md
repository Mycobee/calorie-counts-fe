# Calorie Counts Front-end

This is the front end for our Calorie Counts API.  Please visit the documentation for more info, [here](https://github.com/lpile/calorie-counts)

## Initial Setup

1. Clone this starter kit repository and rename the repository to `calorie-counts-fe` in one command

  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:mycobee/calorie-counts-fe.git
  ```
2. Change into the `calorie-counts-fe` directory

3. Install the dependencies of the starter kit

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

4. Add, commit, and push up to your repository

  ```shell
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit using starter kit"
  git push origin master
  ```

## Running the Server Locally

To see your code in action locally, you need to fire up a development server. Use the command:

```shell
npm start
```

Once the server is running, visit in your browser:

* `http://localhost:8080/` to run your application.

You will need to make sure that your Quantified Self API is also running at `http://localhost:3000`
